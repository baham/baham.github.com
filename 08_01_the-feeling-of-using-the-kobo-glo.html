<p>I wanted to buy an elink ereader long long ago. But I did not buy it, cause I did not have enough money.</p>

<p>After I got my first week salary, I wanted to buy something for myself. I find my roomate Ning has a Kindle 3 ereader. I try to use it, it is pretty cool. And I find it has a enough good reading experienment, though it is an old version of Kindle. You know my salary is not enough to buy a Kindle Paperwhite. When I saw this ereaker, I decided not to buy kpw. After the contrasting with different ereaders, Kindle, kobo, nook. Finally, I decided to buy kobo glo.<!--more--></p>

<ol>
<li>I need a erader with backlit;</li>
<li>The price  less than 650 yuan;</li>
<li>Just an ereader, not an android device;</li>
<li>Bigger screen resolution.</li>
</ol>


<p>So what I contrast are kpw1, kpw2, nook3, nook4, kobo glo. The kobo glo is my last choice.</p>

<p>When you started to use it, you must need a wifi to connect kobo server to update or to buy books. And there are 2 interesting things, &lsquo;Reading Stats and Rewards&rsquo;, very cool tools.</p>

<p>When I thingking how to use this salary, originally, I wanted to but a bike. So I can rike it to church or travel. But Biao advise me to buy a more expensive one,&lsquo;Battle&rsquo;, so I delay buying a bike. But I still will buy one in one day.

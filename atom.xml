    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These days, I got cold. Today is the third day. And I say a wrong word. Orginally, I just want to say a joke. But I found it is bad a bad even evil word. Because I spoke so lordly that someone turn back to see my position.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I am not veru happy, bacause of the cold, the word from the Aunt in dinning hall(I asked her a lunch box, she refused.) and the others&#8217; talking about I using my left hand to eat.</p>

<p>In this time, to think the reson, it is nothing to make me unhappy, I feel.</p>

<p>And Jiao aksed me why use left hand? I wanted to say a joke, so say &lsquo;Why you have so much why?&rsquo; loudly.</p>

<p>It is not polite to her and others in the dinning hall though she did not care it. But I say it. And after the word, I felt really sorry.</p>

<p>I did a bad thing and said a bad word.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started to use <a href="http://goldendict.org/">goldendict</a> since stardict is down. Maybe it is the best dict software on Linux.</p>

<p>So I still keep using it.</p>

<p>But I do not notice which time godendict started to supprot mdx. You know it is very strong, .mdx dictionary.</p>

<p>Because since <a href="http://www.octopus-studio.com/">Rayman Zhang</a> created this software. Lots of men create the dictionaries for mdict with .mdx.</p>

<p>I use the mdict since years ago, that time I still use the windows mobile smart phone.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>These days, I got a new pc from the compony for work, so I want to install golden dict on windows too. But I found the version I downloaded is still 1, and vesion 1 did not support mdx. So I found this link, the goldendict&rsquo;s early access build for windows.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict/wiki/Early-Access-Builds-for-Windows">goldendict 1.5 rc</a></p>

<p>Enjoy it!</p>

<p>And, source code here <a href="https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict/">goldendict source code</a>

<p> So we went to the mpp. It is far away from DD. The most of time of the business trip time is on the road.</p>

<p>Maybe you can not believe it.</p>

<p>This picture cameraed in the Mpp.</p>

<p>The trip is kind of well.</p>

<p>So we exchange requiest and ideas with the Compony A. And I do some recording work. We went to the mpp to see the detail of the plant.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> This is the first Group Travel since I came to the company. And the distination is Hekou Village, it is near North Korea.</p>

<p> Maybe the Dining Hall knew we will travel, so it prepare us this- &lsquo;Liangpi&rsquo; in Chinese.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/hekou/liangpi.jpg" alt="liangpi" /></p>

<p>Maybe it tastes delicious, but if you are hungry, after eating it, you will be still hungry.</p>

<p>After dinner, we set out.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Hekou is not very far from Dandong, just about 100 minutes. Where we live is a peasant&rsquo;s house, his family name is Zhao. After arranging the beds, we came to the port, and get a ship to visit the palces near Yalu River.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/hekou/fisherman.jpg" alt="fisherman" /></p>

<p>The pictures showed Korean fishermen fishing.</p>

<p>And we travel on the ship along the river.</p>

<p>When we came back to the port, Yu want to swim. And the only one girl Jiao went to the shop to buy some little things.</p>

<p>And we found this old plane, <img src="http://baham.co/iamges/hekou/airplane.jpg" alt="plane" /></p>

<p>And a tank,</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/hekou/tank.jpg" alt="tank" /></p>

<p>And who is near the tank is our bus driver. He is a hardworking driver.</p>

<p>This is a happy day.

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/dfmc/flotation.jpg" alt="flotation Agents" /></p>

<p>It is not difficult to do this. But it is complicated. And Liang still want me finishing the Ball Minn Machine data-check task.</p>

<p>But after I came back yesterday, I foung it is the time to go to the cell group meeting, and it woulb be my first time to go to the cell group on Dandong.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I left the company after eating dinner at the dinning hall. Then I went to the place last time Dong told me.</p>

<p>On the road, I met Yi, and we went together a while. When I got there, it is still about 20 minutes before the meeting time.</p>

<p>And in the department the house hold,  there were already 2 brothers, one is Guo, another is Geng. Because of talking, I knew Guo just came back from North Korea. He went to NK nor for Travel, but for Gospel. Though he is younger than me, but what he did I think is more meaningful.</p>

<p>This meeting, we pray, we talk, and about 3 hours later, we left. And this is my first time to listen so much talk from brothers and sisters after I graduated.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to buy an elink ereader long long ago. But I did not buy it, cause I did not have enough money.</p>

<p>After I got my first week salary, I wanted to buy something for myself. I find my roomate Ning has a Kindle 3 ereader. I try to use it, it is pretty cool. And I find it has a enough good reading experienment, though it is an old version of Kindle. You know my salary is not enough to buy a Kindle Paperwhite. When I saw this ereaker, I decided not to buy kpw. After the contrasting with different ereaders, Kindle, kobo, nook. Finally, I decided to buy kobo glo.<!--more--></p>

<ol>
<li>I need a erader with backlit;</li>
<li>The price  less than 650 yuan;</li>
<li>Just an ereader, not an android device;</li>
<li>Bigger screen resolution.</li>
</ol>


<p>So what I contrast are kpw1, kpw2, nook3, nook4, kobo glo. The kobo glo is my last choice.</p>

<p>When you started to use it, you must need a wifi to connect kobo server to update or to buy books. And there are 2 interesting things, &lsquo;Reading Stats and Rewards&rsquo;, very cool tools.</p>

<p>When I thingking how to use this salary, originally, I wanted to but a bike. So I can rike it to church or travel. But Biao advise me to buy a more expensive one,&lsquo;Battle&rsquo;, so I delay buying a bike. But I still will buy one in one day.

Boss Xie had talked with us fresh men about the 3D moduling, he thought the studio need men to build 3D module. And I can kind of use <em>Blender</em>, I told him this.</p>

<p>After this talk, I started learning and using blender again. Though I had no books to watch. But there are many tutorials in my disk, after all, blender is an open software. A few days ago, I finished this flotation separator.<!--more--></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I find church after I came to Dandong. I found a Church in Jvhuashan on the map, but I found it is Sabbath Sect. And I remebered at the last church meeting in CUMT, Duan told us Sabbath Sect is heresy.</p>

<p>But on the road back to the company, I found a plate&mdash;God love the world. And that day is a Thursday, there is a bible study group on Thursday there. So I went there at night.<!--more--></p>

<p>And I posted a post on tieba of LDXY. I asked about if there is fellowship there. Jin told me yes, and gave me qq group ID. I joined it, and after I came back from Wulongbei, On Sunday, I went there with Yan.</p>

<p>And before I left, Aunty Meng told me coming here to church meeting and not going to three self principle church.</p>

<p>But some days later, after I ran back. I met a brother, he is from the Church near  Yuanbaoshan, a 3-self principle church, he told me do not go to underground/family church.</p>

<p>In fact, I prefer to going to family church, cause there are small number of people,  but I went to 3-self principle church too, like at my hometown or in Pingdingshan.</p>

<p>I still remembered Ji&rsquo;s share after he back from Australia, he said, in Australia, different religious sects will sent the posts together, when they have the same centra truth. Does a person be saved depends on family church or 3-self principle church he went to. No, I do not think so.</p>

    <link href="http://baham.co/07_25_the-difference-between-coal-preparation-and-the-metal-preparation.html"/>
    <updated>2014-07-25T12:51:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://baham.co/the-difference-between-coal-preparation-and-the-metal-preparation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of what I learned in university is coal processing, though my major is called mineral processing. And trully, I just learned fewer knowledge about other mineral&rsquo;s processing than coal. But the company&rsquo;s business is more relative about metal. And there was mineral processing training these days. It is about mineral, especially metal. After the company&rsquo;s train and learning in school, I want to talk about the things about the difference between coal and metal. And I want to tell you directly,
<em>There is no difference originally.</em></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Some teachers&#8217; mislead</h2>

<p>Neally all teachers in CUMT tell us most of the CUMT&rsquo;s courses are about coal. Though there are courses about non-metal minerals, iron and smelting, though some teachers disagree.</p>

<p>But they ignore one thing, the methods to prepare minerals is the same.</p>

<h2>There is only one teaching material about Mineral Processing in China</h2>

<p>Not only the method is the same, but the teaching material. I found the students from NEU, CUMTB, HPU who learn Mineral Processing were all using the same book <em>Mineral Processing</em> edited in chage by Xie Guangyuan. Who is the dean of my college.</p>

<h2>The same mechines are used in metal and coal</h2>

<p>Jinjing, Haiwang, Derick the same companies are chosen to choose the mechines during directing plant. In old time, I think there is a lot of difference between designing a mineral praparation plant and a coal preparation plant. After the train, I found it is not, most of the companies&#8217; mechines are for coal or metal or other minerals.</p>

<p>In other words, I hope the graduate from CUMT remember our school&rsquo;s name is CUMT not China&rsquo;s University of Coal and Technology. And I hope the social, the non-coal preparation plant trust graduate from CUMT. We can not only prepare coal but also metal, non-coal.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did not worked in 7 Days Hotel, not lived in &lsquo;7 Days&rsquo; either.</p>

<p>Because the company prepare 7 days to train us, freshmen.</p>

<p>What we do between the train, is learning and knowing each other.</p>

<p>And you know, I am not very good at making friends, or remember new guys. So, in the first several days, I did not do well at knowing each other. But in the last several days, when we knew more about each other, our relashionship is more close.<!--more--></p>

<p>Most of time, I did not drink to avoid being drunk, this time, I drink some beer. When you drink, you want to talk, so I talked more than ever, but I still have clear mind to control my mouth.</p>

<p><code>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. </code>  &mdash;Romans 13:13</p>

<p>And between the 7 days train, there are 2 teachers/ministers&#8217; talk I can not forget. One is the minister of planning department &mdash; Mr Wang, the other is the vice general manager &mdash;Mr Fan.</p>

<p>Wang talked one book&mdash;<em>Secret</em>, the book belongs to New Age Movement. Before I left CUMT, at the last church meeting,  Duan taught us how to distinguish heresy. And she remind us of the New Age Movement and the book <em>Secret</em>.  Maybe Mr Wang is member of the Party, maybe he is not. But what he talked really did not suit the communism, or athesim, and did not suit the Christianity either. And I really want to talk about the religion with him, make him know Jesus.</p>

<p>As Mr Fan, he is smart. He talked a lot. About value of man, about wealth, about work, his experience and so on. And one thing he talked make me remember him. He said &ldquo;Men need Belief, professing a belief in Christianity is more than without belief.&rdquo; And as this word, I do not know wether he has join the Church meeting, and I did not know how to reply, or how to explain the difference of  the belief he said and the belief beliver profess in. So I said nothing, and just listened.</p>

<p>And Fan said men shouldn&rsquo;t attach great importance to wealth, I agrre with him about this, though I am not wealthy. But, after his word, some one express different opinion, said his opinion is all by he is already wealthy.</p>

<p>Men need belief, China needs belief. But communism is not a belief, money is not either. <p class='post-footer' style="font-size:70%;" ></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a Muslim girl in company. I kind of knew her, but she did not. Because when we were still at school to find jobs. I saw her a lot of times in application meeting. And sometimes she introduce herself, I was still at the meeting. And got some information about her. Of cause, I did not do this by purpose. Maybe she did not remember me. But I remembered her. Because she is a Muslim and a Hui nationality girl, and has a boyfriend who is Han nationality, and she had joined one and only one students organization &mdash;Stage Show Organization. And you know I am fan of CUMT Stage Show.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I did not knew her came to the same compony as me until I found her name in the QQ group. And I had talked to her about why came here so far away from her home, she replied me she got this offer firstly.</p>

<p>In one application meeting, I found her is in too. And the HR asked her about her religion and what she is different form Han nationality girl. I generally remember she replied although she is a Hui nationality girl, but after she came to the university, she eat with classmates who are not Muslim, and she has a boyfriend who is a Han nantionality boy.</p>

<p>Though the HR did not say his opinion, did not say why he did not accept her. But that time I felt the HR rejudice her. Not rejudice her grades, or her appearance or her ability. He rejudice her religion. He worried the difference between Han and Hui will make some mistake in the fulture in the compony, though she said she already adopt Han&rsquo;s traditions and habits. The HR&rsquo;s worry is not gone.</p>

<p>Why I write this and why I remeber this, because one day when we ate in the same desktop. I found when she ate, she just eat a few kinds of dishes(without pork). Maybe when she came dfmc&rsquo;s application meeting, she did not emphasize her religion. And the company did not prepare the Islamic food for her. And when I saw this, I really really symphathize her. And I really want to tell her what you eat or waht you did not eat can not make you be saved, or make you be liked by God.</p>

<p>I wanted to, but I really do not know how to, and dare not to. I am a Christian, when I introduce myself, I will tell the listeners, including her, a Muslim. And she is a Muslim, she did not emphasize this. But when she sat before the desktop, I really can not understand her feeling or her thoughts about the food with pork.</p>

<p>I want to help her, not because she is a classmate of mine, not because she is a pretty girl, just because I want to, and not only  her, but also the Koren over the river, and the men who did not believe the God&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>May God bless.</p>

<p><code>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</code>  &mdash;John3:16 <p class='post-footer' style="font-size:70%;" ></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first time to take Toefl Test. After I graduated and left the camp. I prepared for the toefl test. But I didn&rsquo;t prepared it well. I even not finished the one whole office guide test. It is really a pity. Wahtever, the porpose I take it is just verified my English skill, although the scores did not public, but the I achive the porpose, my English-skill is bad.</p>

<p>What I need do is learning and practicing.</p>

<p>The 4 parts in toefl, I nearlly did not finished one of them well.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In Reading Section, After I finished the first one, I found I did not have enought time . And I feel nervous, and you know, many answers are guessed by me.</p>

<p>And the listening section, what I pay the muchest time to practice, but what I can understand is just a little. And I was too tired to concentrate on the convesations or lecture. This is a lesson, when you take the test, you must sleep well and enough.</p>

<p>Then it is speaking, I found I can not read the paragraphes on time. As for the questions about speaking by oneself, I could not prepare them well in 15 seconds. I need to practice thinking in the heart with English.</p>

<p>What is the last is Writing Section. Maybe it will gave me the best score in 4 parts. But you know, they are still not good articles, it&rsquo;s just like an articles that writen by a pupil. not like an article by a high school graduation.</p>

<p>What I need to practice and learn is very much.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> I bought a train ticket from Heb to Dandng, though I can not get on the car in Heb City. Because I found I can buy a sleeper ticket from Heb, not from my hometown. So I bought this ticket.</p>

<p>A few days later, when I went to get the ticket, I found I mmade a mistake, the ticket I bought is a student ticket. But you know I am not a student anymore. So the functionary asked me for the student card, I could not gave it. So what I can do is getting a refund for the ticket. And buy a chair ticket from my hometown. What the puzzle I will face with is I need sit on a chair more than 9 hours during the night. It will make me tired.</p>

<p>Before I leaving home, I pray to God for my travel, my safety  and my job.</p>

<p>I arrived at railway station about 6 pm, but the arrving in the raiway&rsquo;s time is about 5 hours later. So I went to Wanda Cinema to watch <em>Transform 4</em>. Though the ticket is expensive.<!--more--></p>

<p>This is my first time to watch <em>Transform</em>.</p>

<p>When the time is up, I went to the station to get on the railway. When I was on the railway, I found the functionary said there is an opportunity to buy a sleeper ticket. So I queue, although there is someone jumping the queue, There is an amazing thing happen, I bought the sleeper ticket, the last one.</p>

<p>When I get the sleeper ticket, I went to the sleeper car. I through many sleeper cays. Some has a very bad smell from someone&rsquo;s feet. I said in my heart I do not want to meet the one with bad feet smell. Finally, it did. But I found another bad thing, someone near me  snored with a very big noise. I could not wake him up, we did not know each other. What I can do is praying, like Hu said his experience with his roommate, I pray for my sleep time. It worked, subway started, I fell in a sleep until the nexr day&rsquo;s morning.</p>

<p>And there was another thing happen, when I queue to buy the sleeper ticket, I bought the last one, The functionary said, I got an amazing phone number and the ID number and the ticket number. And you know I bought the last sleeper ticket.</p>

<p>Am I lucky?</p>

<p>No! It is all on God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>

<p>Because there is a word in Holy Bible&mdash;</p>

<p><code>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.  </code>  &mdash; John 16:1

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My old android phone is broken, it can not start up. I did not know why? Because when I pluged in its battery on the night. It still could work. But when I wake up, it could not start up.</p>

<p>So I just found out my old Windows Mobile phone, my first smart phone with 64Mhz cpu and 64M ram, but it rum more smoothly than most cheap android phones.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>But there is a problwem when I use the wm phone, cause it can not get a normal signal. The intensity it get is alwasy weak. So I need a new phone. Though I want to buy a new phone after I started to work originally.</p>

<p>The Nokia X is my first choice, because of Nokia&rsquo;s fame. But most of markets did not sell it. So I bought a samsung android phone. And it is cheaper than nokia x. Cause I just need an android smart phone which can run smoothly. This samsung phone is enough for me. And I can not afford an expensive phone. So I choose it.</p>

<p>Android, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Phone, Tizen &hellip; there are more and more phone os now. But the os I like mostly is wm.</p>

<p>Smooth, Light, though ms would not support it. Writing this article is to remember the OSes, and the smartphones I used.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The school ask us to leave by 6.23, I left at June 23. I wanted to leave at 21. But I change the plan to decide to leave at 6.23.</p>

<p>I took the railway and the taxi to home.</p>

<p>There are cleaner air in hometown than Xuzhou or other cities I had visited in China.</p>

<p>But you know the time to work is coming. So there is not much time for me to stay in hometown. And I still had a Toefl test to take.</p>

<h2>Guy from South China on Railway</h2>

<!--more-->


<p>When the railway is arriving My Province, the guy in a lower berth spoke something to another one. And I talked to him about trifles.</p>

<p>After the talk, I found goal is near my home. But the difference is that I need take a taxi, but he wanted to ride a bike to the destination. He graduate from Guangdong and worked in Nanjing before coming here.</p>

<h2>Girls near my berth</h2>

<p>There are 6 berthes right of my berth. After arriving my destination  I found there are 3 girls who knew each other, and 2 girls who knew each other, and 1 elder women who is not like a student. You know that 3 girls always talked. And I just listen, they talked boyfriend, wealth, life and so on. And you know it is a time to listen, to listen girls&#8217; thoughts and feelings.</p>

<h2>Family left of my berth.</h2>

<p>On the left of my berth, there is one family, one daughter, one father, and one mother. The daughter is just like me, graduated from college and went back home. They live in Liaoning Province. The daughter studied in Nanjing. And theis pronunciation is kind of like Ma.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This travel maybe is the my last travel from Xuzhou. My students who still in Xuzhou they saw me off, and Sha, Hu, Ji did too. Really thanks them.</p>

<p>But I did not cry, though I was sad, I was reluctant to leave the fellowship, the friends, the Bible Group &hellip;  When Dai asked me when I will be back to the fellowship. I answered maybe never. But Ji corrected me. He said we at last had one chance to see each other, we will see each other in the heaven. I said a wrong word. His correct is right.</p>

<p><code>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</code>    &mdash;Ecclesiastes 9:10</p>

<p>Do what you need to do.

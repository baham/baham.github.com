<p>And Wang and I came.</p>

<p>Just on the road, we take about more than one day.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The sky is blue, the air is clean. Though I was a little tired. But still had a not bad emotion.</p>

<p>And you know this land is Empire Mongolia&rsquo;s base. So when I saw grassland. I thought of the history.</p>

<p>When I went into the city, I found the city in Mongolia is different with in inlands. The road is more wide, amount of people is more less.</p>

<p>And the small city is more like the America city in lots of films.

    <id>http://baham.co/360wifi-be-evil</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/360wifi/360wifi2.jpg" alt="360wifi" /></p>

<p>These days, I found there is a 360wifi on the public PC. So I got the ssid and the password to get the internet access.</p>

<p>But when I use this 360wifi to access internet. I found an evil thing 360 done.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>When I visit django</h2>

<p>I wanted to learn some knowledge about django. When I use my laptop to visit djangoproject.com, I got nothing, but a <em>Server Not Found</em></p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/360wifi/snf.png" alt="server not found" /></p>

<p>But when I use the public pc that installed 360wifi, I can access djangoproject.com.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/360wifi/django.png" alt="django" /></p>

<h2>Inference</h2>

<p>So I infer that 360wifi block some foreign websites. include:</p>

<p><a href="http://djangoproject.com">django</a>, turbogears, pip, and my vps&rsquo;s ip.</p>

<p>They are all blocked.</p>

<p>And I think there are more sites and ips were blocked by 360wifi.</p>

<h2>Others</h2>

<p>I do not know how about the similar products in China, like <em>baidu wifi</em> or <em>xiaomi wifi</em>.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>I found this abnormal phenomenon, but I still did not know why.</p>

<p>I wanted to learn some about django or turbogears to build a site, but why 360wifi block them.</p>

<p>Did these sites include some bad things or bad plugins or even break the law? But you know, they are all open source project, and only for the developers to download software and get docs.</p>

<h2>Advise</h2>

<p>So my adivise is use a wireless network card instead of the 360wifi. Maybe using wireless network card is more difficult to config, but it is more safe and free.</p>

<pre><code>The Life is Short, Away from 360
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought a bicycle weeks ago, a mountain bike. It cost me more than half of my month salary. (Of course, my salary is pretty low) lol.</p>

<p>And today, I ride this bike with Wei who ride a Meride bicycle to travel to Donggang.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In fact, the sistance between start and the end is more than 40 km, and we need to come back before night. So we strated to ride in the morning.</p>

<p>And this is my first time to ride so far.</p>

<p>There are strong wind. And we must faced it, this is a problem, and make us feel tired.</p>

<p>When we were on the road, we found this place.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/donggang/xia.jpg" alt="xiachang" /></p>

<p>I think it is a place to get salt. Even I got some powder to tast. It is salty, but in fact, finally I found it is not the place to get salt.</p>

<p>It is the place for farmer to get shrimps &hellip;</p>

<p>And I saw the horizon.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/donggang/horizon.jpg" alt="horizon" /></p>

<p>When we come bakc, I wanted to travel more, but Wei is tired and just wanted to went back as quick as we can. And I did not consider this that time, and I blame he is not good at watching map and insisted on findding a new way back.</p>

<p>So I did a wrong thing, just consider my own things and thoughts and did not consider the other&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Finally, we went back along the old way.</p>

<p>Thanks God.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> I am learning mineral processing in my university. When I graduate and started to work, I came here and got my first job.</p>

<p> Maybe no position will satisfy a man in a company. And I believe all things depend on God. So I just follow the boss&rsquo;s opinion. And worked here do the designing direction job.</p>

<p> <!--more-->
 After the meeting between DFMC and <a href="andestc.cl">Andes</a> a young company from Chile, B and J told me maybe I was more suitable with the Researching direction job.</p>

<p> And this is the third time I heard the advise from cowork. For B have told me the advise before. This time, J even said she can help me talk to boss.  Really thanks her, but I did not accept her good willing, after all I had talked this with the boss.</p>

<p> For now, the researching direction job is building the <strong>Mineral Processing Expert System</strong> that I think I would do when I came here. But the boss let me do the designing direction, do some plant&rsquo;s automation solution design.</p>

<p> Days ago, I talked to the boss, I told him I was good at programming and I had got some knowlege about matlab and metsim which softwares researchers in the company used. But he refused, he did not refuse directly, but he just said the researching job need the man who got Master Degree {in fact, not all of researchers got master degree.) and it is more difficult and hard. Though I express I can work hard and I did not fear hard. He still refuse.</p>

<p> Between the talk, I found he already made decision and would not change. So I stop talking and just listen.</p>

<pre><code> Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.  Rom 13:1

 So I took the boss's advise and still worked in disign direction. Not because of his talk, but God's word.

 And thanks God.

<p>Luckily, when I reached, the meeting had not started.</p>

<p>The reporter is Gao. who graduated from NEU and lived in AUS now. He report some new information and technology about the Australian Mineral Processing. Some bigger and newer machines.</p>

<p>And some new theories in foreign.</p>

<p>Like, SAG flowsheet, SAB, SABC flowsheet. And in froth flotation, how to control the separation and measure what.</p>

<p>Which is the best bubble&rsquo;s diameter in flotation? And you know the company is building the Mineral Processing Expert System. So Gao said some about expert system and JKmetsim that I knew but never used and touched software.</p>

<p>This is a good experiment.

    <updated>2014-10-28T13:53:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://baham.co/chinas-transgenic-calibration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Maybe a few people care about China&rsquo;s trangenic calibration.</p>

<h2>Before, China&rsquo;s transgenic food was qualitatively calibrated.</h2>

<p>If the food include transgenic part, than calibrated it &lsquo;Transgenic&rsquo;.</p>

<p>But in fact, like other regulations in China, a lot of people think the aim did not achieve. A lot of food whith &lsquo;Transgenic&rsquo; did not be calibrated. And the food without transgenic part calibrated with &lsquo;non-transgenic&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>And Now, China&rsquo;s transgenic food will be quantitatively calibrated.</h2>

<p>In fact, I thought this is a regression. But the medium did not say it is a regression, they said US/ Japan do like this too.</p>

<p>So this is the problem.</p>

<p>For me,
I do not care how much transgenic part a food have, I just care whether it has or not. Although, I probably had aten transgenic food with I have no idea which food have.

<p>Because since <a href="http://www.octopus-studio.com/">Rayman Zhang</a> created this software. Lots of men create the dictionaries for mdict with .mdx.</p>

<p>I use the mdict since years ago, that time I still use the windows mobile smart phone.</p>

<p> So we went to the mpp. It is far away from DD. The most of time of the business trip time is on the road.</p>

<p>Maybe you can not believe it.</p>

<p>But it is reall, I think maybe this thing can only happened in China.</p>

<p>The trip is kind of well.</p>

<p>So we exchange requiest and ideas with the Compony A. And I do some recording work. We went to the mpp to see the detail of the plant.</p>

<p>Then we went back.</p>

<p>What I found from this business trip is business trip is not an easy work, cause maybe you will take most of trip time on the road.

<p> Maybe the Dining Hall knew we will travel, so it prepare us this- &lsquo;Liangpi&rsquo; in Chinese.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/hekou/liangpi.jpg" alt="liangpi" /></p>

<p>Maybe it tastes delicious, but if you are hungry, after eating it, you will be still hungry.</p>

<p>After dinner, we set out.</p>

<p>Hekou is not very far from Dandong, just about 100 minutes. Where we live is a peasant&rsquo;s house, his family name is Zhao. After arranging the beds, we came to the port, and get a ship to visit the palces near Yalu River.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/hekou/fisherman.jpg" alt="fisherman" /></p>

<p>The pictures showed Korean fishermen fishing.</p>

<p>And we travel on the ship along the river.</p>

<p>When we came back to the port, Yu want to swim. And the only one girl Jiao went to the shop to buy some little things.</p>

<p>And we found this old plane, <img src="http://baham.co/iamges/hekou/airplane.jpg" alt="plane" /></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These 2 days, I was busy at the <code>Flotation Agents Auto-Adding Machine</code>&rsquo;s debugging and testing. Because it will be sent to Jin Chuang Group to be tested by Mineral Preparation Plants.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/dfmc/flotation.jpg" alt="flotation Agents" /></p>

<p>It is not difficult to do this. But it is complicated. And Liang still want me finishing the Ball Minn Machine data-check task.</p>

<p>But after I came back yesterday, I foung it is the time to go to the cell group meeting, and it woulb be my first time to go to the cell group on Dandong.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I left the company after eating dinner at the dinning hall. Then I went to the place last time Dong told me.</p>

<p>On the road, I met Yi, and we went together a while. When I got there, it is still about 20 minutes before the meeting time.</p>

<p>And in the department the house hold,  there were already 2 brothers, one is Guo, another is Geng. Because of talking, I knew Guo just came back from North Korea. He went to NK nor for Travel, but for Gospel. Though he is younger than me, but what he did I think is more meaningful.</p>

<p>This meeting, we pray, we talk, and about 3 hours later, we left. And this is my first time to listen so much talk from brothers and sisters after I graduated.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to buy an elink ereader long long ago. But I did not buy it, cause I did not have enough money.</p>

<p>After I got my first week salary, I wanted to buy something for myself. I find my roomate Ning has a Kindle 3 ereader. I try to use it, it is pretty cool. And I find it has a enough good reading experienment, though it is an old version of Kindle. You know my salary is not enough to buy a Kindle Paperwhite. When I saw this ereaker, I decided not to buy kpw. After the contrasting with different ereaders, Kindle, kobo, nook. Finally, I decided to buy kobo glo.<!--more--></p>

<ol>
<li>I need a erader with backlit;</li>
<li>The price  less than 650 yuan;</li>
<li>Just an ereader, not an android device;</li>
<li>Bigger screen resolution.</li>
</ol>


<p>So what I contrast are kpw1, kpw2, nook3, nook4, kobo glo. The kobo glo is my last choice.</p>

<p>When you started to use it, you must need a wifi to connect kobo server to update or to buy books. And there are 2 interesting things, &lsquo;Reading Stats and Rewards&rsquo;, very cool tools.</p>

<p>When I thingking how to use this salary, originally, I wanted to but a bike. So I can rike it to church or travel. But Biao advise me to buy a more expensive one,&lsquo;Battle&rsquo;, so I delay buying a bike. But I still will buy one in one day.

Boss Xie had talked with us fresh men about the 3D moduling, he thought the studio need men to build 3D module. And I can kind of use <em>Blender</em>, I told him this.</p>

<p>After this talk, I started learning and using blender again. Though I had no books to watch. But there are many tutorials in my disk, after all, blender is an open software. A few days ago, I finished this flotation separator.<!--more--></p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/mineral/flotation2.jpg" alt="FS" /></p>

<p>It is not very cool, or verisimilitude. But at least, when I show this to Biao, he can recognize it.

<em>The Great Hypnotist</em> in Chineseit is called  <strong>催眠大师</strong>.</p>

<p>A movie about a successfull Psychiatrist. And It is B-Movies. They only frame an old house, a bar and a car &hellip; It is very low-cost.</p>

<p>But in China, this is not normol.</p>

<p>Cause since theater allows playing American movies, people knew high cost of films, and more and more pictures companies prone to shoot high-cost films and earn more.</p>

<p>But this movie is different. It is a low-cost movie.</p>

<p>Further, not only the cost is different.</p>

<p>In China, there is nearlly no thriller or horror films. Because the SARFT dislike. They like <em>Red Films</em> and <em>Disaster in Foreign nations movies</em>. And most of thriller or horror film would not be approved.</p>

<p>But this thriller and suspense is approved.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><img src="http://img5.douban.com/view/photo/photo/public/p2177018166.jpg" alt="mowenwei" /></p>

<p>And I just want to say this is a very good movie.</p>

<p>In recent years, there is just a few good movies. Maybe there are hundreds of movies released in China. But there is just only a few good movies.</p>

<p>Most of movies just can get a score lower than 5  in douban movie(A China&rsquo;s IMDB).</p>

<p>But this moive got 7.8 . And if I give the score, I will gave it 8.5 .</p>

<p><embed src="http://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XNjc1NzkwMjgw/v.swf" allowFullScreen="true" quality="high" width="480" height="400" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></p>

<p>If you have a chance watch this movie, I advise you to get it.</p>

<h2>PS: Some Rules of China&rsquo;s Movie or the SARTF&rsquo;s rules</h2>

<h3>No Ghosts</h3>

<p> Every ghost will be taken place by a moster.</p>

<p> Or the ghost will be explained to a sick man.</p>

<h3>No Poli/tical Events</h3>

<p> You know.</p>

<h3>Must show Hate on WAR2 Movie</h3>

<p> If you show love, friendship between Japanese and Chinese, the movie will not be approved. Just Like Jiang Wen&rsquo;s movie &mdash;<em>Devils on the Doorstep</em></p>

<h3>No sex</h3>

<p> Even in a romance movie, if you show a long time sex screen, it will not be approved.</p>

<p> Buy you know sex is a gift from GOD, showing it on the time is reasonable.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p> Binding the abrove rules, there will not many good movies in China.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Labor Day, there are 2 meetings, One is Niu&rsquo;s web meeting, the othe is church&rsquo;s meeting in Xuzhou countryside.</p>

<p>I wake up at about 6:40 am and call Qing wake up.</p>

<p>And eat, and take iron plates with Qing to the school&rsquo;s door. Waited for others to go to the church meeting.</p>

<p>The place there is called 4 Pu, it means <code>Castel 4</code>, but there are not castels, lol.</p>

<p>When we get there, the others from our fellowship was still in the web meeting.</p>

<p>And I help to take the meat off from bamboo slip and string them up with iron slip.</p>

<p>It is an easy job but boring. But I am tired cause it is a good thing for others.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Gao then tell us to go west to have a game. It is calles <em>Transfer the silent word</em></p>

<p>Then there is a family game <em>Throw and Take</em>, and we students from our school join too. And I played with a boy Su too. It is a kind of fat boy, but cute.</p>

<p>Then we get back to our camp. I still did some work to help others.</p>

<p>At noon, we ate. And the others from web meeting arrived.</p>

<p>We played other games , one is called <em>Transfer Plus Power</em>, it is a good game and a good name.</p>

<p>Zhang tell us a class about <em>Love</em> between person and person, husband and wfe, boyfriend and girl friend, and family and family. there is a book or topic called * Love&rsquo;s 5 Languages*</p>

<p>When the meeting end, we help the host to to do some farm work, just like the day&rsquo;s name, <code>Labor Day</code> It is for worker.</p>

<p>And when I went to the well, I saw a turkey, at least I think it is a turkey.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/fellowship/turkey.jpg" alt="Turkey" /></p>

<p>And when I wen to the WC, I saw a <em>marsh gas pool</em>, at least I think it is too.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/fellowship/gas.jpg" alt="marsh gas pool" /></p>

<p>It is my first time to see these 2 things.</p>

<p>This is a happy day. Thanks! God! <p class='post-footer' style="font-size:70%;" ></p>

    <id>http://baham.co/21-24-octopress-orinal-link-bug-fix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you use the original post footer plugin, some bug will happen, I do not know the bug&rsquo;s detail, but I still find a way to fix it.</p>

<p>Cause when the bug happend, this will show:</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/octopress/plugin-bug.jpg" alt="post afer footer" /></p>

<p>The code will show, when the article&rsquo;s end is a link or a picture.</p>

<p>Why does this happen?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>  It is the crash of language&rsquo;s syntax. When you use the octopress to <code>generate</code> the posts, ruby&rsquo;s script run, and some html&rsquo;s commna code is not a common code. And the commit&rsquo;s symbol is different too.</p>

<p>So I modify this plugin to avoid this bug.</p>

<p>I just take place of <code>%Q{}</code> with <code>&lt;&lt;_here2start _here2start</code></p>

<p>And now, the code after the article will not show, and just show the normal content.</p>

<p>Like the below. And the source is here:  <a href="http://baham.co/04_29_octopress-seo.html">SEO tool to octopress</a>

<h2>Add Original Link after the Post</h2>

<p>Mr Sunshine write an article about how to add space between Chinese Word and English Word.  Inspired by this, Kevin write a ruby plugin to add the <em>original link</em> after the octopress post. It is awesome.</p>

<p>And Tiny change the plugin to add the keyword after the <em>octopress post</em> also. So I just read the source code and add edit it for myself.</p>

<p>The file is here&mdash;<a href="https://github.com/minghub/octopress-add-original-link/raw/master/octopress-add-original-link.rb">octopress-add-original-link.rb</a></p>

<p>And after I modified, It is only can show the post&rsquo;s original link.</p>

<p>Before you use it, you need to edit your <code>_config.yml</code>, and add these.</p>

<pre><code>original_url_pre: "The Original Link: "
license_url: /license
license_name: "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0"
</code></pre>

<p>The contents after <code>:</code> , you need edit them by yourself for your site.</p>

<h2>Add Keywords and Description for the Post and the Page</h2>

<p>It will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/baham/keywords.jpg" alt="keyword" /></p>

<p>And what you need to do is just add <code>post.puts "keywords: "</code>  <code>post.puts "description: "</code> in your <code>Rakefile</code></p>

<p>Like this</p>

<pre><code>
  puts "Creating new post: #{filename}"
  open(filename, 'w') do |post|
    post.puts "---"
    post.puts "layout: post"
    post.puts "title: \"#{title.gsub(/&/,'&amp;')}\""
    post.puts "date: #{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}"
    post.puts "comments: true"
    post.puts "categories: "
    post.puts "keywords: "
    post.puts "description: "
    post.puts "---"
</code></pre>


<p>Maybe you will need <code>CTRL+F</code>to find the <code>post.puts</code></p>

<p>And it is the same as adding the <strong>keywords and description</strong> to the <code>page</code> in octopress.</p>

<h2>Add the Keywords And Description to The Whole Octopress Site</h2>

<p>It is more easy, just add</p>

<pre><code>description: "Description for the website"
keywords: "keywords, for, the, website"
</code></pre>

<p>in your octopress&rsquo;s <code>_config.yml</code> file, and modify the <code>source/_includes/head.html</code> after the author meta like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (add_keywords_and_description.rb)</span> <a href='http://baham.co/files/code/add_keywords_and_description.rb'>download</a></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'>   <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">capture</span> <span class="n">description</span> <span class="sx">%}{% if page.description %}</span><span class="p">{{</span> <span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">description</span> <span class="p">}}{</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">elsif</span> <span class="n">site</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">description</span> <span class="sx">%}{{ site.description }</span><span class="p">}{</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="sx">%}{{ content | raw_content }</span><span class="p">}{</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">endif</span> <span class="sx">%}{% endcapture %}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">meta</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;description&quot;</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{{ description | strip_html | condense_spaces | truncate:150 }}&quot;</span> <span class="sr">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr"> {% capture keywords %}{% if page.keywords %}{{ page.keywords }}{% elsif site.keywords %}{{ site.keywords }}{% endif %}{% endcapture %}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr"> &lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;{{ keywords | strip_html | condense_spaces }}&quot; /</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After the modifying, when you check the <code>keywords</code> and <code>Description</code>, they will show what you add in <code>_config.yml</code></p>

<p><strong>I think you will like it, my octopressers.</strong></p>

    <id>http://baham.co/3-hours-in-zhengzhou</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was in Pingdingshan, I need to came back to Xuzhou City to get my debit card.</p>

<p>So I asked 2 day for leave.</p>

<p>But the ticket of train from Pingdingshan to Xuzhou with a chair is gone. So I bought a ticket from Pingdingshan to Zhengzhou and a ticket from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou.</p>

<p>So I have about 3 hours to travel in Zhengzhou and to wait for the train.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Zhengzhou City is a big city in central China. It is the biggest city in Henan. Its name ccame from the Zheng Kingdom in Zhou Dynasty.</p>

<p>I did not really travel there, just bought something and wook the subway to the banks to ask about the visa debit card. Cause you know I need a visa card to pay the mensa test fee. That time, I think maybe there were some big backs would support some visa or master debit card. And I think the cards would get at once. In fact, my thought was wrong.</p>

<p>But it is not a bad experience. Cause I saw something.</p>

<p>I saw this poster on the wall near the road. And in winter holiday, I saw them in my hometown too.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/zz/gd.jpg" alt="gd" /></p>

<p>There are 3 words there, maybe you can not understand them. Sincerely, I did not understand them too.</p>

<p>But the translations to English were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Thanks! My Country and parents!</li>
<li>Sing a folk song for the P!</li>
<li>Long Live the P!</li>
</ol>


<p>I really can not understand these words. It is like in a old kingdom country not like in a modern country.</p>

<p>And this is show a phenomnon in China, Nearly everyone dislike the p, but most of people still want to be the member. maybe they want to get the power, the economic power, the trust by g.o.v and so on. So sometimes they lie.</p>

<p>And there another picture in tunnel of  Zhengzhou subway station.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/zz/gd2.jpg" alt="gd2" /></p>

<p>It means &ldquo;Why China can be so strong? Cause we have the p.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I take a photo about this building.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/zz/atower.jpg" alt="atowerinzhengzhou" /></p>

<p>It make me think of Tower Defense Games, like dota. LoL!!!</p>

<p>The p means <img src="http://baham.co/images/zz/p.jpg" alt="p" /></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pingdingshan city is also called Eagle City. And it is rich with coal, most are for coking.</p>

<p>I had an about 20 days internship here.</p>

<p>So if I describe the story with nothing omitted, it will take a long time.</p>

<p>So I just try to keep ths story short.</p>

<p>Where we lived is Tianhong Hotel. Where we watch were Tianzhuang Coal Preparation Plant and Tianhong Coal Preparation Plant.</p>

<p>And we also went to Beijing Huayu Company.</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<h2>Huayu</h2>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/pds/huayu.jpg" alt="huayudoor" /></p>

<p>Huayu is a company to design a coal preparation plant.</p>

<p>It is one of the best in China.</p>

<h2>Tianzhuang Coal Preparation Plant</h2>

<p>It is very old plant, there are about 2 thousand workers.</p>

<p>And it is very jam-packed. So we could not watch everywhere in the plant.</p>

<p>So I learned the most in Tianhong Coal Preparation Plant among 3 places.</p>

<p>The load and transport system.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/pds/load.jpg" alt="loan and transport" /></p>

<h2>Tianghong Coal Preparation Plant</h2>

<p>It is not like Tianzhuang, it is too new to produce coal product.</p>

<p>So we although stayed there less in time, we watched and learned more.</p>

<p>We took some pictures and drawed some images to show the plant.</p>

<p>If you want to know it and learn it, you can <a href="http://baham.co/contactme-en">ask me</a> for it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first day in Guangzhou City, there is the Exchange Dream by Jiaqian.</p>

<p>So when I went to Sun Yat-sen University to join in it.</p>

<p>It is my second time to take Guangzhou Train. And when got there, I didn&rsquo;t know where is north. So I thount and found it by the building&rsquo;s  window(You know although in sourth of China, people still build the big window to sourth).</p>

<p>And with the map, I found the university. But I did not get it, so I asked a passby, he told me the position.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/guangdong/sunyatsen.jpg" alt="sun-yat-sen-university" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>So I went to the classroom where the Exchange Dream started. I foung it before the activity started. And I was hungry, though I had a Niunan Noodle on the road to train stop, the noodle tasted really bad. So I asked a girl where is refectory or dining hall.</p>

<p>She gave me a direction but it is not very clear. Then I went out of the classroom to the refectory.</p>

<p>I did not found it, I walked back and asked a passby. She told me she went there too that I can followed her. And we went the refectory together.</p>

<p>On the road, we talk a few things about the Sun Yat-sen University , her major and why I was here.</p>

<p>Then I arrived in the refectory, I bought a meal ticket, and took some rice and some vegetables to eat(like Popeye the Sailor).</p>

<p>After the dinner, I went back to the calssroom. It is about 7 pm, but Jiaqian was still not arrive.</p>

<p>We waited for about 2/3 hour. She came. And I shared a story about my entering a higher school. And listend more stories from others.</p>

<p>The number of viewers in Sun Yat-sen is less than CUMT. But there are more interesting stories.</p>

<p>And the two girls who was left from me are just hign school students, so young and so cute.</p>

<p>A girl shared her childhood and love story, another girl shared her hairstyle and she how to bet with her deskmate, a boy just standed there until the activity stoped &hellip;
<img src="http://baham.co/images/guangdong/jiaqian.jpg" alt="exchangedream" />
After it, I went back by train. It is so late, so I took a shower, watche a little TV and just slept for tomorrow&rsquo;s test.</p>

<p>Oh there is a very cool thing in Sun Yat-Sen University, an old style&rsquo;s washing room.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know Shenzhen is the most biggest 4 cities in China. And it is a Special Area in Ecnomic. And a citizen in Shenzhen can go to Hongkong freely. But the citizens in other part of China can not.</p>

<p>Sicerely, Shenzhen is a pretty fashion and open city. But there are still some China&rsquo;s Characteristics in Shenzhen.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>When I arrive in Luohu Port, I saw some young men sell milk powder. I do not know these young men are from Hongkong or Mainland, but they just sit near the port and sell the milk powder.</p>

<p>In China, there is an incident happend that milk powder is posionous. And some babies got sick by the posionous milk powder.</p>

<p>So someone smuggle milk powder from HK to CN.</p>

<p>And this is my first time to experience to see the milk powder from HK.</p>

<p>Out of the port building, there are a lot of people selling goods(I guess they are smuggled goods) in the square. There are too many to count the number.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/guangdong/smuggle.jpg" alt="Smuggler" /></p>

<p>The square is near the port and train station. And there are policemen or city managers. But they still sell the goods. And no policemen or city managers care about them. You know smugglling break the law.</p>

<p>I think because even policemen or city managers also want their babies have no-posion milk powder.</p>

<p>After the travel near the port. I went on the train to see the sea.</p>

<p>Follow the map&rsquo;s direction, I came to A train stop near the sea.</p>

<p>And I walked to sourth by my feet.</p>

<p>I go across a residential district and in map, it is near the sea.</p>

<p>So I walked and foung the beach. Until I saw a tunnel under the highway. I go pass it. And I saw an armed policeman camp, but I did not care it and still went following the map.</p>

<p>I walked and walked, there was a cross.</p>

<p>2 policemen saw me and asked me what was I doing.</p>

<p>And I told them I came here to see the sea and the mangrove. And something about me.</p>

<p>They told me I can not come here, Here was never opened for people.</p>

<p>So I turend and go back.</p>

<p>They after me on the bikes, one on the bike told me he can give a drive.</p>

<p>I thanked go on the bike. So they take me out of forbidden zone. We talked on the road. They two were just  as young as me. They are kind, and told me go to the Mangrove Stop to see the sea and mangrove in Shenzhen.</p>

<p>Then I followed their advise to take the taxi there.</p>

<p>When I arrived, it is already dark.</p>

<p>I felt the wind from the Shenzhen Bay and saw the bustling and flourishing buildings in Shenzhen and the bridge between Shenzhen and Honkong.</p>

<p>Then I went back to the Shenzhen Train Station and went to Guangdong.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a old word in China, it is <em>to Travel Thousands Miles is More Than to Read Thousands Books</em>.</p>

<p>Before I got to Guangzhen, I decided to travel to Shenzhen after the mensa test in Guangzhou.</p>

<p>So at about 15:00 April 19, I arrived the train to Shenzhen. After about 90 minutes. I arrived Shenzhen City.</p>

<p>I had only two purposes.</p>

<p>One is to watch Honkong, the other is to see sea.</p>

<p>After I got out of the train station. I bought a map of Shenzhen. And I found Luohu Port is just near the train station.</p>

<p>So I walked to Luohu Port.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>But when I arrive the port. I found you can see nothing.</p>

<p>There is a port building <img src="http://baham.co/images/guangdong/luohuport.jpg" alt="luohuport" />
and after the building , there is a police station,
after the station, there are mountains.</p>

<p>You know, In the media in China, they always insist on that Hongkong is one part of China. But I a Chinese went to Hongkong is more difficult than a foreigner. This is a really bad thing.</p>

<p>In the back of the port building , I take a picture with my phones&rsquo;s camera.</p>

<p><img src="http://baham.co/images/guangdong/bird.jpg" alt="HK CN bird" /></p>

<p>A bird can fly over the port freely, but a man can not.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 2 years ago, I wanted to join mensa. Cause in <a href="http://iqtest.dk">iqtest.dk</a>, I have gotten a 130 score.</p>

<p>But you know in 2012, the mensa.org.cn showed the number in 2012 is to achieve the max number. So I waited.</p>

<p>And the mensa.org.cn showed test will open in 2013.</p>

<p>But in 2013, the test did not open until the December in 2013.</p>

<p>And I knew there was something happen in mensa-china. But recently, the <a href="http://mensa-china.com">mensa-china.com</a> opened, although I would be in internship in April 19, I still decided to ask for leave to take the test.</p>

<p>But I found this test must be paid by paypal, and the method of paying the fee doesn&rsquo;t support alipay or unipay card.</p>

<p>So i asked Brother Jun to help me pay the fee by using his credit card(both visa and unipay). But I ignored one thing that paypal need use the credit card of the account register.</p>

<p>Then one bad thing happend. I did not pay the fee successfully, and the credit card of Brother Jun was freezed.</p>

<p>After that day, I called paypal to solve this.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So I decide to registe a visa card, but I was just a student, so I could only a debit card, so I registed Minsheng Back Internation Debit Card(The program of regist needs 7 work days). And I asked more 2 days for leave to get the card.</p>

<p>When I came Xuzhou to get the card, I failed, cause the card did not arrive Minsheng Bank Xuzhou. I found one to transfer some dollars to my paypal account.</p>

<p>And I paid the fee.</p>

<p>In April 17, I left Pingdingshan City to Guangzhou City to take the test. In April 19, I took the test. And in the quiz after the test and a book, I got a highest score in who submit less in 25 minutes in my test batch(批次). It is really lucky, and may this little honor belong to God.</p>

<p>You know during the test, I got five or six questions too hard to solve them, just like I took the test in <a href="http://iqtest.dk">iqtest.dk</a>. But still thanks God. Because finally I paid successfully, I took the test successfully, and I arrived in Guangzhou on time and so on.

<p>When we got there, there were just a few brothers and sisters here.And after we put bibles to the chairs. More ones came.</p>

<p>When we started, we sang a welcome song for the newers(I was new that time ).Then we sang songs to praise God. And one brother sang a song called <em>You are my favorate</em>, It is really a beautiful song (Sorry I did not remember the brother&rsquo;s name, but I record the song). And one sister who is a lead singer in the church  sang a song too, beautiful too.</p>

<p>After the Easter show, Priest Ma to teach us about <em>Jesus&rsquo;s Eternal Love</em>. It really made me moved.</p>

<p>Then our American brothers and sisters show a show about Jesus&rsquo;s Story(I recorded it too). It is a really good show.</p>

<p>In this morning. I knew two new guys, Brother Ding from Shantou and Brother Ren Xiaorong from US.</p>

<p>Xiaorong is really a open man. And he is really conscientious to learn Chinese. When we talk to Mensa and Tieba, he took seriousty to record it by phone. And he is a man who will talk to you firstly.</p>

<p>About on noon, we ate food. After that I left to train stop.</p>

<p>This is a really good and happy experience. Thanks God!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gnome3 is pretty cool.
Though a lot of men do not like it.</p>

<p>But finally I choose it after I try kde unity elightment gnome2.</p>

<p>Why ?</p>

<p>Cause I think a pc or laptop. The most important thing is easyuse.</p>

<p>And Gnome3 dit it.</p>

<p>Be not like gnome2, so old and out of fashion.</p>

<p>Be not like kde, so big and so many config choices.</p>

<p>Be not like unity, just belong to Ubuntu.</p>

<p>So for now gnome3 is the best choice for me.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I did not write articles a long time.</p>

<p>Even dit not write golang everyday.</p>

<p>When I use gnome3 ,I found this extension. So cool!</p>

    <updated>2014-03-10T07:16:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://baham.co/octopress-easypost-tool</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When using octopress to write articles.
You need run commands like this.
1. rake new_post[&lsquo;name&rsquo;]     //to post an article
2. rake generate        //to create the html files
3. rake deploy      //to push your articles</p>

<p>When I use Ubuntu 12.04, even I need add <code>bundle exec</code> to fix the gem version problem.</p>

<p>Cause I am in China, to fix the TimeZone problem, I need to add <code>TZ=CCT</code></p>

<p>So before you write your article, you have already write <code>TZ=CCT bundle exec rake new_post......</code></p>

<p>And when change my os to <strong>Ubunt Gnome</strong>, I found an article about using octopress easily.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Here is it.  An Chinese coder&rsquo;s <a href="http://my.oschina.net/u/160375/blog/160342">article</a> on oschina blog.</p>

<p>This man write an shell script to write octopress articles more easily.</p>

<p>I found it is really useful.</p>

<p>Here is the code.</p>

<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh
root=/my/blog/path
scriptName=`basename $0`
cd $root
case $1 in
    'blog')
        name=`date +"%H-%M-%S"`
        if [[ $2 ]]; then
            name=`echo $2|sed 's/ /-/g'`
        fi
        path=`rake new_post[$name]|awk -F":" '{print $2}'`
        vi $path
        ;;
    'page')
        if [[ ! $2 ]]; then
            echo 'need page name'
            exit
        fi
        name=`echo $2|sed 's/ /-/g'`
        echo $name
        path=`rake new_page[$name]|awk -F":" '{print $2}'`
        vi $path
        ;;
    'view')
        rake preview
        ;;
    'publish')
        rake gen_deploy
        ;;
    'build')
        rake clean
        rake generate
        ;;
    'open')
        open $root
        ;;
    'edit')
        vi $root
        ;;
    *)
        echo "usage: $scriptName [blog|page|view|publish|build|open|edit]"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
</code></pre>


<p>Unfortunately, I found a bug when you write an article with article name.</p>

<p>It showed <code>not found [[</code> or somethin \g like this.</p>

<p>And this shell use <em>blog page build &hellip;</em> comands, it is more difficult than <strong>new_post new_page generate</strong></p>

<p>So I changed the commands name to <code>post page preview deploy generate open edit</code></p>

<p>And add 2 commands <code>gen_pre gen_dep</code></p>

<p>And change generate to generate not <code>gen_deploy</code></p>

<p>And this is <a href="https://github.com/minghub/octopress-easy-post-tool.git">github link</a>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My old android phone is broken, it can not start up. I did not know why? Because when I pluged in its battery on the night. It still could work. But when I wake up, it could not start up.</p>

<p>So I just found out my old Windows Mobile phone, my first smart phone with 64Mhz cpu and 64M ram, but it rum more smoothly than most cheap android phones.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>But there is a problwem when I use the wm phone, cause it can not get a normal signal. The intensity it get is alwasy weak. So I need a new phone. Though I want to buy a new phone after I started to work originally.</p>

<p>The Nokia X is my first choice, because of Nokia&rsquo;s fame. But most of markets did not sell it. So I bought a samsung android phone. And it is cheaper than nokia x. Cause I just need an android smart phone which can run smoothly. This samsung phone is enough for me. And I can not afford an expensive phone. So I choose it.</p>

<p>Android, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Phone, Tizen &hellip; there are more and more phone os now. But the os I like mostly is wm.</p>

<p>Smooth, Light, though ms would not support it. Writing this article is to remember the OSes, and the smartphones I used.</p>

<p>Must I use google as my search engineer? No, But I need to use digg to read my feed, use utb to watch some cool videos and these websites kind of need google&rsquo;s service.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first day in Guangzhou City, there is the Exchange Dream by Jiaqian.</p>

<p>So when I went to Sun Yat-sen University to join in it.</p>

<p>It is my second time to take Guangzhou Train. And when got there, I didn&rsquo;t know where is north. So I thount and found it by the building&rsquo;s  window(You know although in sourth of China, people still build the big window to sourth).</p>

<p>And with the map, I found the university. But I did not get it, so I asked a passby, he told me the position.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So I went to the classroom where the Exchange Dream started. I foung it before the activity started. And I was hungry, though I had a Niunan Noodle on the road to train stop, the noodle tasted really bad. So I asked a girl where is refectory or dining hall.</p>

<p>She gave me a direction but it is not very clear. Then I went out of the classroom to the refectory.</p>

<p>I did not found it, I walked back and asked a passby. She told me she went there too that I can followed her. And we went the refectory together.</p>

<p>On the road, we talk a few things about the Sun Yat-sen University , her major and why I was here.</p>

<p>Then I arrived in the refectory, I bought a meal ticket, and took some rice and some vegetables to eat(like Popeye the Sailor).</p>

<p>After the dinner, I went back to the calssroom. It is about 7 pm, but Jiaqian was still not arrive.</p>

<p>We waited for about 2/3 hour. She came. And I shared a story about my entering a higher school. And listend more stories from others.</p>

<p>The number of viewers in Sun Yat-sen is less than CUMT. But there are more interesting stories.</p>

<p>And the two girls who was left from me are just hign school students, so young and so cute.</p>

<p>A girl shared her childhood and love story, another girl shared her hairstyle and she how to bet with her deskmate, a boy just standed there until the activity stoped &hellip;

After it, I went back by train. It is so late, so I took a shower, watche a little TV and just slept for tomorrow&rsquo;s test.</p>

<p>Oh there is a very cool thing in Sun Yat-Sen University, an old style&rsquo;s washing room.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now, all over the world, there is a lot of activities to commemorate Mandela. Even in China, even In official  medium. And these official medium would emphasize to Mandela resist white people. But you know, <strong>pure Mandela&rsquo;s mind</strong> is to resist unfair not white people.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Obviously, in China there is a Mandela too. And China&rsquo;s Mandela&rsquo;s last name is Liu and Wei and Tan and &hellip;</p>

<p>And somenone we call him China&rsquo;s Mandela is still in the jail. I just want to say do not foget him.</p>

<p><strong>Do not foget the man who resist unfair like Mandela.</strong></p>

<p>Dead man is dead but alive man is alive.</p>

<p><code>May God Bless China!</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> In May 21, the day of <code>521</code>, just like the word &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; in Chinese.</p>

<p> And in the morning, I went to Mineral Research Center to visit the Tan to check my drawing of the Coal Preparation Plant. And she and Mr Peng and others give a lot of advice and show some mistakes. So I need to take much time to redraw it.</p>

<p> And after noon. There is a report in college, I went to join it. Professor Zeng Hongbo make this report about some reseach in University of Alberta. He is less than 30,  but already was a professor.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After te report, I found the time is 4 pm, and Miss Zhang send me a message about the Ordination. And I called Ma. She told me she will went back to dormitory firstly. And I think I need too. But when I came to the door of my dormitory, I found it is 4:20. We need to arrive North Gate before 4:40-50.</p>

<p>So I decided to buy a bottole of water and just go north. But Ma did not show.</p>

<p>And I sent a message to ask her where she is. She was in the dormitory and she tell me wait for her. Though I already was on the car to the North Gate, I off the car.</p>

<p>Some minutes later. She came, we went to the North and met Uncle Yao.</p>

<p>And we started to go to the XiXiang Church. It is a long distance. And we talked, talked about a lot of things. From now to a long time ago. Maybe when there 2 people who know each other with a long distance, they will talk a lot more than ever and shared their thought. And when we arrived Xi Xiang Church, It is about 6 pm.</p>

<p>And in Xi Xiang, I found we two have a job to hold the plate with presants.</p>

<p>Pator Ma Wenlong, a pator from US give me a talk about of heart and leadship of pator.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> 还有几天就是圣诞节，今天兄弟姐妹们提前以圣诞之名聚集在一起，感谢主。另外，Ji弟兄从澳洲回来，给大家做了一个以自己信仰和求学经历的分享。分享很不错，受益匪浅。</p>

<p> 诗歌敬拜之后，是bin哥的分享，随后就是Ji弟兄分享。最让人印象深刻的是Ji弟兄和他GF的情感历程分享，两人同在矿大团契，年级却差了三年，而两人关系确立也是在一个在澳洲、一个在国内。总之，在听两人分享时，很感动，感动两人的历程、更感动于神的大功。</p>

<p> 两人一个在赤道南、一个在赤道北，一个在太平洋南，一个在太平洋西。但这却没成为两人之间的阻隔，反而成为两人确立关系的催化剂。而在该姊妹（Sorry 还没记住名字）分享时，她做见证说（大意如下）：
  “当他发了这句<strong>耶稣爱你，我也爱你</strong>过后，我给了他发了一封邮件。当我还犹豫不决时，很多人发来的经句（没记住，但都表达出，这是神的旨意）。虽然如此，我还是决定再向神确认。我打电话给他，说这一周不要给我打电话。然后，我向神祷告，求主说，这一周谁给我第一个打电话，谁就是主您给我安排的另一半。”（可能和姊妹原话有出入，但能保证整体无误）</p>

<pre><code>结果，当晚Ji弟兄电话来了。
</code></pre>

<p> 神对这对儿弟兄姊妹的爱在这一刻就显明了。<strong>神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。</strong></p>

<p> <strong>主若愿意，我们就可以活着，也可以作这事，或作那事。</strong></p>

<p> <em>好久没有写golang的博文了，最近一直忙着实验报告，明天还要赶CAD作业，紧接着还有课程设计，可能Golang内容会停更一段时间，但是会保证有时间后会补回来</em></p>

<pre><code>愿主保佑这个国家！
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</em> was writen by John Bunyan. And it was published in Feb 1678.</p>

<p>It is a novel and it is about faith.</p>

<p>I have 2 reasons to read it.
1. Know more about faith
2. Improve my English skill</p>

<p>Moreover, there is a paper book in my school&rsquo;s library, though it is very old（about 50 years）.</p>

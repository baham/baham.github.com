Boss Xie had talked with us fresh men about the 3D moduling, he thought the studio need men to build 3D module. And I can kind of use <em>Blender</em>, I told him this.</p>

<p>After this talk, I started learning and using blender again. Though I had no books to watch. But there are many tutorials in my disk, after all, blender is an open software. A few days ago, I finished this flotation separator.<!--more--></p>

<p>It is not very cool, or verisimilitude. But at least, when I show this to Biao, he can recognize it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did not worked in 7 Days Hotel, not lived in &lsquo;7 Days&rsquo; either.</p>

<p>Because the company prepare 7 days to train us, freshmen.</p>

<p>What we do between the train, is learning and knowing each other.</p>

<p>And you know, I am not very good at making friends, or remember new guys. So, in the first several days, I did not do well at knowing each other. But in the last several days, when we knew more about each other, our relashionship is more close.<!--more--></p>

<p>Most of time, I did not drink to avoid being drunk, this time, I drink some beer. When you drink, you want to talk, so I talked more than ever, but I still have clear mind to control my mouth.</p>

<p><code>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. </code>  &mdash;Romans 13:13</p>

<p>And between the 7 days train, there are 2 teachers/ministers' talk I can not forget. One is the minister of planning department &mdash; Mr Wang, the other is the vice general manager &mdash;Mr Fan.</p>

<p>Wang talked one book&mdash;<em>Secret</em>, the book belongs to New Age Movement. Before I left CUMT, at the last church meeting,  Duan taught us how to distinguish heresy. And she remind us of the New Age Movement and the book <em>Secret</em>.  Maybe Mr Wang is member of the Party, maybe he is not. But what he talked really did not suit the communism, or athesim, and did not suit the Christianity either. And I really want to talk about the religion with him, make him know Jesus.</p>

<p>As Mr Fan, he is smart. He talked a lot. About value of man, about wealth, about work, his experience and so on. And one thing he talked make me remember him. He said &ldquo;Men need Belief, professing a belief in Christianity is more than without belief.&rdquo; And as this word, I do not know wether he has join the Church meeting, and I did not know how to reply, or how to explain the difference of  the belief he said and the belief beliver profess in. So I said nothing, and just listened.</p>

<p>And Fan said men shouldn&rsquo;t attach great importance to wealth, I agrre with him about this, though I am not wealthy. But, after his word, some one express different opinion, said his opinion is all by he is already wealthy.</p>

<p>Men need belief, China needs belief. But communism is not a belief, money is not either.</p>

    <id>http://baham.co/a-muslim-girl-i-know</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a Muslim girl in company. I kind of knew her, but she did not. Because when we were still at school to find jobs. I saw her a lot of times in application meeting. And sometimes she introduce herself, I was still at the meeting. And got some information about her. Of cause, I did not do this by purpose. Maybe she did not remember me. But I remembered her. Because she is a Muslim and a Hui nationality girl, and has a boyfriend who is Han nationality, and she had joined one and only one students organization &mdash;Stage Show Organization. And you know I am fan of CUMT Stage Show.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I did not knew her came to the same compony as me until I found her name in the QQ group. And I had talked to her about why came here so far away from her home, she replied me she got this offer firstly.</p>

<p>In one application meeting, I found her is in too. And the HR asked her about her religion and what she is different form Han nationality girl. I generally remember she replied although she is a Hui nationality girl, but after she came to the university, she eat with classmates who are not Muslim, and she has a boyfriend who is a Han nantionality boy.</p>

<p>Though the HR did not say his opinion, did not say why he did not accept her. But that time I felt the HR rejudice her. Not rejudice her grades, or her appearance or her ability. He rejudice her religion. He worried the difference between Han and Hui will make some mistake in the fulture in the compony, though she said she already adopt Han&rsquo;s traditions and habits. The HR&rsquo;s worry is not gone.</p>

<p>Why I write this and why I remeber this, because one day when we ate in the same desktop. I found when she ate, she just eat a few kinds of dishes(without pork). Maybe when she came dfmc&rsquo;s application meeting, she did not emphasize her religion. And the company did not prepare the Islamic food for her. And when I saw this, I really really symphathize her. And I really want to tell her what you eat or waht you did not eat can not make you be saved, or make you be liked by God.</p>

<p>I wanted to, but I really do not know how to, and dare not to. I am a Christian, when I introduce myself, I will tell the listeners, including her, a Muslim. And she is a Muslim, she did not emphasize this. But when she sat before the desktop, I really can not understand her feeling or her thoughts about the food with pork.</p>

<p>I want to help her, not because she is a classmate of mine, not because she is a pretty girl, just because I want to, and not only  her, but also the Koren over the river, and the men who did not believe the God&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>May God bless.</p>

<p><code>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</code>  &mdash;John3:16</p>

    <link href="http://baham.co/10_20_jin-tian-de-mian-shi-jing-yan.html"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> 有些时候，你确实能感觉到“人生的大起大落”，造化弄人。</p>

<p>今天去“东方测控”，宣讲后，投递了自己的简历。我以为“以我掌握五门计算机语言的能力”得到一次面试机会，应该没问题，结果，第一次起落发生了。</p>

<p>同去宣讲的同学，陆续接到电话、面试，而我却迟迟没有动静，正在准备简历投递其他公司后，戏剧性的一幕发生了，我手机收到了一个陌生号码的来电，我已经猜到了，一定是企业方。果然，通知我7点面试。</p>

<p>在得到机会后，我有些小激动，因为这家企业福利虽然并不吸引人，但是离家近、而且不用去选煤厂，虽然毗邻朝鲜。</p>

<p>我兴奋之余，淡定地把手头的简历投递走，然后，提前去了现场，想先去了解了解面试程序，结果，却被赶回来。</p>

<!--more-->


<p>回来吃饭、换衣服，然后，6点40多到达了现场。</p>

<p>首批面试，采取座谈方式，几个人围着面试官，到我时，问我“浅槽、斜轮同时布置时，哪个会在前边？”</p>

<p>我很肯定地回答：“浅槽。”</p>

<p>——Ｗｈｙ？</p>

<p>——因为浅槽入洗粒度大，既然力度更大，自然放在前边。（我记着隋师兄说过，浅槽可以实现全粒级入洗）</p>

<p>而后，问到其他人时，有人回答：“斜轮”</p>

<p>后来自己想一想，<strong>有把斜轮放原煤车间的，没有放浅槽的。</strong></p>

<p>其实，这个问题，问地并不好，很莫名其妙，但是这也给我了一条教训。</p>

<pre><code>这种情况，理应后答，无论自己多么肯定，不要争先。

甚至在思考后，提出自己对问题的质疑。
</code></pre>

<p>以此题为例，浅槽、斜轮同为主洗设备，理应互为后备，不当分先后。</p>

<p>当然，我的一切但凭我主耶稣基督定夺，主让我得到机会，主让我被面试淘汰，自有其道理。</p>

<p>一切凭我主、凭我神，而我的意愿永远是第二位的。</p>

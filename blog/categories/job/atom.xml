    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> I am learning mineral processing in my university. When I graduate and started to work, I came here and got my first job.</p>

<p> Maybe no position will satisfy a man in a company. And I believe all things depend on God. So I just follow the boss&rsquo;s opinion. And worked here do the designing direction job.</p>

<p> <!--more-->
 After the meeting between DFMC and <a href="andestc.cl">Andes</a> a young company from Chile, B and J told me maybe I was more suitable with the Researching direction job.</p>

<p> And this is the third time I heard the advise from cowork. For B have told me the advise before. This time, J even said she can help me talk to boss.  Really thanks her, but I did not accept her good willing, after all I had talked this with the boss.</p>

<p> For now, the researching direction job is building the <strong>Mineral Processing Expert System</strong> that I think I would do when I came here. But the boss let me do the designing direction, do some plant&rsquo;s automation solution design.</p>

<p> Days ago, I talked to the boss, I told him I was good at programming and I had got some knowlege about matlab and metsim which softwares researchers in the company used. But he refused, he did not refuse directly, but he just said the researching job need the man who got Master Degree {in fact, not all of researchers got master degree.) and it is more difficult and hard. Though I express I can work hard and I did not fear hard. He still refuse.</p>

<p> Between the talk, I found he already made decision and would not change. So I stop talking and just listen.</p>

<pre><code> Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.  Rom 13:1

 So I took the boss's advise and still worked in disign direction. Not because of his talk, but God's word.

 And thanks God.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Xiong gave me a job, it is went to the Mineal Preparation Plant to do some information exchange work with Tao and make me know more about design automation project.</p>

<p> So we went to the mpp. It is far away from DD. The most of time of the business trip time is on the road.</p>

<p>Maybe you can not believe it.</p>

<p>This picture cameraed in the Mpp.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>But it is reall, I think maybe this thing can only happened in China.</p>

<p>The trip is kind of well.</p>

<p>So we exchange requiest and ideas with the Compony A. And I do some recording work. We went to the mpp to see the detail of the plant.</p>

<p>Then we went back.</p>

<p>What I found from this business trip is business trip is not an easy work, cause maybe you will take most of trip time on the road.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These 2 days, I was busy at the <code>Flotation Agents Auto-Adding Machine</code>&rsquo;s debugging and testing. Because it will be sent to Jin Chuang Group to be tested by Mineral Preparation Plants.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dfmc/flotation.jpg" alt="flotation Agents" /></p>

<p>It is not difficult to do this. But it is complicated. And Liang still want me finishing the Ball Minn Machine data-check task.</p>

<p>But after I came back yesterday, I foung it is the time to go to the cell group meeting, and it woulb be my first time to go to the cell group on Dandong.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I left the company after eating dinner at the dinning hall. Then I went to the place last time Dong told me.</p>

<p>On the road, I met Yi, and we went together a while. When I got there, it is still about 20 minutes before the meeting time.</p>

<p>And in the department the house hold,  there were already 2 brothers, one is Guo, another is Geng. Because of talking, I knew Guo just came back from North Korea. He went to NK nor for Travel, but for Gospel. Though he is younger than me, but what he did I think is more meaningful.</p>

<p>This meeting, we pray, we talk, and about 3 hours later, we left. And this is my first time to listen so much talk from brothers and sisters after I graduated.</p>

<p><code>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</code> &mdash;Mattew 1:20</p>

Boss Xie had talked with us fresh men about the 3D moduling, he thought the studio need men to build 3D module. And I can kind of use <em>Blender</em>, I told him this.</p>

<p>After this talk, I started learning and using blender again. Though I had no books to watch. But there are many tutorials in my disk, after all, blender is an open software. A few days ago, I finished this flotation separator.<!--more--></p>

<p>It is not very cool, or verisimilitude. But at least, when I show this to Biao, he can recognize it.</p>

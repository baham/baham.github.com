    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Xiong gave me a job, it is went to the Mineal Preparation Plant to do some information exchange work with Tao and make me know more about design automation project.</p>

<p> So we went to the mpp. It is far away from DD. The most of time of the business trip time is on the road.</p>

<p>Maybe you can not believe it.</p>

<p>This picture cameraed in the Mpp.</p>

<p>But it is reall, I think maybe this thing can only happened in China.</p>

<p>The trip is kind of well.</p>

<p>So we exchange requiest and ideas with the Compony A. And I do some recording work. We went to the mpp to see the detail of the plant.</p>

<p>Then we went back.</p>

<p>What I found from this business trip is business trip is not an easy work, cause maybe you will take most of trip time on the road.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These 2 days, I was busy at the <code>Flotation Agents Auto-Adding Machine</code>&rsquo;s debugging and testing. Because it will be sent to Jin Chuang Group to be tested by Mineral Preparation Plants.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dfmc/flotation.jpg" alt="flotation Agents" /></p>

<p>It is not difficult to do this. But it is complicated. And Liang still want me finishing the Ball Minn Machine data-check task.</p>

<p>But after I came back yesterday, I foung it is the time to go to the cell group meeting, and it woulb be my first time to go to the cell group on Dandong.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I left the company after eating dinner at the dinning hall. Then I went to the place last time Dong told me.</p>

<p>On the road, I met Yi, and we went together a while. When I got there, it is still about 20 minutes before the meeting time.</p>

<p>And in the department the house hold,  there were already 2 brothers, one is Guo, another is Geng. Because of talking, I knew Guo just came back from North Korea. He went to NK nor for Travel, but for Gospel. Though he is younger than me, but what he did I think is more meaningful.</p>

<p>This meeting, we pray, we talk, and about 3 hours later, we left. And this is my first time to listen so much talk from brothers and sisters after I graduated.</p>

<p><code>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</code> &mdash;Mattew 1:20</p>

Boss Xie had talked with us fresh men about the 3D moduling, he thought the studio need men to build 3D module. And I can kind of use <em>Blender</em>, I told him this.</p>

<p>After this talk, I started learning and using blender again. Though I had no books to watch. But there are many tutorials in my disk, after all, blender is an open software. A few days ago, I finished this flotation separator.<!--more--></p>

<p>It is not very cool, or verisimilitude. But at least, when I show this to Biao, he can recognize it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did not worked in 7 Days Hotel, not lived in &lsquo;7 Days&rsquo; either.</p>

<p>Because the company prepare 7 days to train us, freshmen.</p>

<p>What we do between the train, is learning and knowing each other.</p>

<p>And you know, I am not very good at making friends, or remember new guys. So, in the first several days, I did not do well at knowing each other. But in the last several days, when we knew more about each other, our relashionship is more close.<!--more--></p>

<p>Most of time, I did not drink to avoid being drunk, this time, I drink some beer. When you drink, you want to talk, so I talked more than ever, but I still have clear mind to control my mouth.</p>

<p><code>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. </code>  &mdash;Romans 13:13</p>

<p>And between the 7 days train, there are 2 teachers/ministers' talk I can not forget. One is the minister of planning department &mdash; Mr Wang, the other is the vice general manager &mdash;Mr Fan.</p>

<p>Wang talked one book&mdash;<em>Secret</em>, the book belongs to New Age Movement. Before I left CUMT, at the last church meeting,  Duan taught us how to distinguish heresy. And she remind us of the New Age Movement and the book <em>Secret</em>.  Maybe Mr Wang is member of the Party, maybe he is not. But what he talked really did not suit the communism, or athesim, and did not suit the Christianity either. And I really want to talk about the religion with him, make him know Jesus.</p>

<p>As Mr Fan, he is smart. He talked a lot. About value of man, about wealth, about work, his experience and so on. And one thing he talked make me remember him. He said &ldquo;Men need Belief, professing a belief in Christianity is more than without belief.&rdquo; And as this word, I do not know wether he has join the Church meeting, and I did not know how to reply, or how to explain the difference of  the belief he said and the belief beliver profess in. So I said nothing, and just listened.</p>

<p>And Fan said men shouldn&rsquo;t attach great importance to wealth, I agrre with him about this, though I am not wealthy. But, after his word, some one express different opinion, said his opinion is all by he is already wealthy.</p>

<p>Men need belief, China needs belief. But communism is not a belief, money is not either.</p>

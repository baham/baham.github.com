    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The school ask us to leave by 6.23, I left at June 23. I wanted to leave at 21. But I change the plan to decide to leave at 6.23.</p>

<p>I took the railway and the taxi to home.</p>

<p>There are cleaner air in hometown than Xuzhou or other cities I had visited in China.</p>

<p>But you know the time to work is coming. So there is not much time for me to stay in hometown. And I still had a Toefl test to take.</p>

<h2>Guy from South China on Railway</h2>

<!--more-->


<p>When the railway is arriving My Province, the guy in a lower berth spoke something to another one. And I talked to him about trifles.</p>

<p>After the talk, I found goal is near my home. But the difference is that I need take a taxi, but he wanted to ride a bike to the destination. He graduate from Guangdong and worked in Nanjing before coming here.</p>

<h2>Girls near my berth</h2>

<p>There are 6 berthes right of my berth. After arriving my destination  I found there are 3 girls who knew each other, and 2 girls who knew each other, and 1 elder women who is not like a student. You know that 3 girls always talked. And I just listen, they talked boyfriend, wealth, life and so on. And you know it is a time to listen, to listen girls' thoughts and feelings.</p>

<h2>Family left of my berth.</h2>

<p>On the left of my berth, there is one family, one daughter, one father, and one mother. The daughter is just like me, graduated from college and went back home. They live in Liaoning Province. The daughter studied in Nanjing. And theis pronunciation is kind of like Ma.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This travel maybe is the my last travel from Xuzhou. My students who still in Xuzhou they saw me off, and Sha, Hu, Ji did too. Really thanks them.</p>

<p>But I did not cry, though I was sad, I was reluctant to leave the fellowship, the friends, the Bible Group &hellip;  When Dai asked me when I will be back to the fellowship. I answered maybe never. But Ji corrected me. He said we at last had one chance to see each other, we will see each other in the heaven. I said a wrong word. His correct is right.</p>

<p><code>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</code>    &mdash;Ecclesiastes 9:10</p>

<p>Do what you need to do.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, brothers and sisters got together to learn God&rsquo;s words and say goodbye to graduates, like me.</p>

<p>I came to the fellowship in September 2013, and now I will leave.</p>

<p>And I find a difference between I came and I left, before I came to the fellowship, I had a heart made up of stone, but now I feel my heart is made up of flesh. What or who gave me this difference, I thing is God&rsquo;s words, it is Bible, it is Spirit.</p>

<p>I always thought I would not be sad when I graduate. But I find I am wrong, now. Because I feel sadness.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Before noon, Mrs Zhang call me to ask me about how to get water. And I just came to the fellowship.
I arrived at about 12:30, and there are many elders and classmates, I felt sleepy, cause I had a habit to sleep at noon.</p>

<p>I did not know how to say. So I just write it sorted by the time.</p>

<p>I bought steamed breads and condiments.</p>

<p>We sang songs to admire and praise God.</p>

<p>Pastor Lu gave us a lesson about how to keep the faith after graduatation in this guilty World.</p>

<p>A presentation of graduates, and I am the first, I did not prepare fot it.</p>

<p>Receiving the gifts and elders gave us a blessing and lesson(Pastor Yao and Aunt Diao and so on).</p>

<p>Cells' shows, and I paly a harmonica show and sang it  /simple gift/.</p>

<p>We lined in 2 circles and said goodbye.</p>

<p>We ate. There are really many people this time. Maybe 40-50 people.</p>

<p><code>I really don't know how to describe this day, what I can do is just write the title and keep the memory in my mind.</code></p>

<p>Thanks God!</p>

<p><code>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</code>  &mdash;Luke 10:27</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every year, Stage Play Corporation in CUMT put a stage play. This year, my last year in University, the stage show is called &ldquo;Rhinoceros in Love&rdquo;, and the four years in university, I watched the stage show from this corporation 3 times, this is the third time.</p>

<p>The first stage show I watched in CUMT is called &ldquo;暗恋桃花源&rdquo; in Chinese, the second was &ldquo;红玫瑰与白玫瑰&rdquo;, writed by Ailing Zhang, the title means &ldquo;Red Rose and White Rose&rdquo;. You know, all these three are about love.</p>

<p> This time getting a ticket of the stage show is more difficult than ever. There are 3 times to send the free tickets in the camp, I went twice but got nothing. So I gave up to watch the show, cause the third sending tickets was at Wen Chang Camp, I did not want to go so far to get the ticket.</p>

<p> But on Saturday, I had no intention of talking about the show with Ying at the fellowship when she finished cooking the dinner, she said she would do ask her friends as best as she can.
 <!--more-->
 At night back from fellowship, I send a message to Yan to remind her and asked her about my harmonica&rsquo;s show&rsquo;s time, after she sent back, I sent a message to ask about the show&rsquo;s ticket, cause I knew she do some students' job, and I knew maybe she had tickets.</p>

<p> She told me she want to watch too, but she did not get the ticket either. So I slept, cause tomorrow I wanted to join the praying in the morning. And shutdowned or airplaned my tcl and huawei phone.</p>

<p> I woke up about 6 am on Sunday, and I did not watch the phone.</p>

<p> On the road to the fellowship, I saw Ren, but he walked so fast that I could not get him, after I turned right out the sourth gate, I heard some steps, and I turn back, there is a girl, Yan. She told me maybe I did not receive the message she sent, I took out my phone from my pocket, I found she told me she get 2 tickets and invite me to watch the show.</p>

<p> <code>What a surprise.</code></p>

<p> Before the time the show started, we get on the bus hired by Materail College and we talked a lot on the road, about TV, driving exam, movies, novels and so on. And she tell me the captain teacher, that who really like the show, the art and literature.</p>

<p> When we arrived in Wenchang Camp, the theatre is neally full filled. And there are many my classmates, Jin, Ren, Jiao, Wu and so on.</p>

<p> In the show, there is an interlude, the song from Skeeter Davis&mdash; &lsquo;the end of the world&rsquo;, the song I really like, (And this song is used in Hanhan’s film &mdash; <em>Hou Hui Wu Qi</em>, It means ‘never meet again’. And it is used in ‘Under the Doom’ too. )</p>

<p> When we got back to the Nanhu Camp, I lent my onda pad for Yan, Cause I found she did not get throuth the driving exam and had a android pad not used for a long time, though that time I found my pad’s battery is empty, and the app was uninstalled.</p>

<p> What a happy day and a meaningful experience, and thanks God to give me this happy experience and such beautiful friendship.</p>

<p>And thanks  Yan&rsquo;s help.</p>

    <link href="http://baham.co/11_23_yue-qi-bei-bai-ke-zhi-shi-jing-sai.html"/>
    <updated>2013-11-23T14:08:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://baham.co/yue-qi-bei-bai-ke-zhi-shi-jing-sai</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> 孙越崎，浙江人，中国最早学习矿冶专业的人之一，早年学文，后转投矿冶科。因其为中国能源行业做出的贡献，以及政治立场上远离于台湾，所以，虽然身为国民党（后入民革），在大陆并没有被批判或抹黑。</p>

<p> 我们学校，特设有“孙越崎”学院，而且也有其半身像。而且每年还会举办<strong>“越崎杯”百科知识竞赛</strong>。</p>

<p> 可能，很多人对这种活动不感兴趣，毕竟没有素质分，但我与众不同，我很喜欢这类百科知识类的活动。我还记得，曾经参加一个<strong>答对一道问题就给一块糖</strong>的活动，我回答了三个问题，全部答对，拿了3块糖，第四道题，我就主动放弃了。同行的同学，向我要糖，我没给，因为，我把这三块糖当成荣誉。所以说，这类活动我很喜欢，但凡有，也一直基本都参加。
 有一次，上课和一位女同学谈论起这类活动，她告诉我说：
 <!--more-->
<strong> 这类活动都是有题库的。</strong>
ps:当时的话茬是这样开始的:
1, 她问我“毕业之后，想去干什么”，
2, 我说“过日子呗”，（<strong>颜回言志</strong>的故事，孔子问弟子志向，前几位都说出世，、做官、实现抱负，偏偏颜回说，愿平平安安过日子，然后，孔子没有称赞别人，唯独称赞了颜回）
3, 她说“你这么有才华！”（当你被认同时，有没有很激动的感觉？）
4, 然后，就说起了这类活动，我当时就是表达了一下“人外有人”的意思，说“比你（值我自己）强的永远比你差的多……”
5, 再后，就是她告诉我题库的事</p>

<p>好了，废话说多了，不过，我觉得这段话还是值得记录，毕竟是得到认可。</p>

<p>我当时，震惊、不解、无奈、失望、疑惑……</p>

<p>实在不理解考察百科知识，为什么给题库，这不就成为考察记忆力了吗？不是应当靠日积月累吗？
我甚至想，她是不是很善良地在安慰我。</p>

<p>直到今天，我发现她是对的，因为真的有题库。</p>

<p>我已然无话可说了：</p>

<p><strong>病入高肓的高等教育啊</strong></p>

    <link href="http://baham.co/11_09_jin-tian-de-bai-bing-ju-hui.html"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天的团契聚会（双选会，中午没有睡觉，现在有点困，可能写得无逻辑，望读者见谅。），是掰饼聚会。</p>

<p>印象比较深的是陆老师，对于是否入Ｄ的建议：</p>

<p>1, 作为信神的人，尽量不要入。他举了一个例子，有位同学，大学时深思熟虑入了Ｄ，在徐州一切都好，但在读研究生后，去了另一个城市，第一次参加学校的团契，就被各领导叫去谈了两个小时……</p>

<p>2, 虽然如此，但约瑟、但以理却都是身在异帮，却保守了自己的信仰，并切实为自己的族人带来了蔽益</p>

<p>总之，最终的意见就是<strong>慎重且自决</strong>。</p>

<!--more-->


<p>另外，回学校的路上，排队时，后边的同学主动说要看看我的圣经。</p>

<p>有时候，我不带圣经，因为嫌麻烦。毕竟，手机里字体更大，且不会因为晚上照明不足看不清。但今天，中午走的时候，我把圣经带上了，而《圣经》让我身后的这位同学知道学校里有<strong>团契</strong>，让一只迷失的羔羊可能因此找到牧者。在此，不得不感谢我神。</p>

<p>其实，我以前就有过这种想法，把圣经拿在手上，有些时候不是为了看（因为手机也可以看），而是为了间接传播主的福音让慕义之人能得到，也是告诉世人，我是我父的孩子，
因为主说过：</p>

<pre><code>凡在人面前认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必认他。                   太10:32
</code></pre>

<p>May god be with you!</p>
